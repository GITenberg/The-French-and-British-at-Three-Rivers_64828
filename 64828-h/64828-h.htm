American continent. The French claims were largely based upon the discovery
of the St. Lawrence by Cartier in 1521, and subsequent exploration
of the interior of the Continent by Champlain, La Salle, and other Frenchmen.
Ultimately, the territory which the French pre-empted included the
St. Lawrence Valley, the Great Lakes region, the territory extending southward
to the Ohio River, the territory immediately west of the Mississippi
River, and that part of the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico adjacent to the
mouth of the Mississippi River. The French exploited the fur-trading and
fur-producing possibilities of this vast empire; French priests sought the
conversion of the Indian inhabitants to the Catholic faith; French military
forces established a chain of forts or posts extending along the Great Lakes,
down the Wabash River, and along the Mississippi River to the Gulf. Numerous
Frenchmen came to this interior region, but few Frenchwomen accompanied
them; consequently, French settlements were relatively few
and weak. Many Frenchmen formed temporary or permanent unions with
Indian women, and in the next generation a considerable number of half-breeds
were born of these unions. Important French posts in the area were
Presque Isle, Mackinac, Detroit, Post Miami, Vincennes, New Orleans,
Kaskaskia, and St. Louis.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>The environs of the Indian village of Kekionga, located in the present
Lakeside section of Fort Wayne, were selected by the French for the
location of Post Miami, because of combined strategic, economic, and
geographic significance. The village was located at the confluence of the
St. Joseph and St. Mary&rsquo;s Rivers. It was, therefore, on water highways
connecting with Lake Erie and tapping the interior of Michigan and Ohio.
Kekionga was only a few miles from the Wabash River with the St. Lawrence-Mississippi
watershed lying between the two. A shallow lake, since
drained out of existence, extended southwest from Kekionga to present-day
Waynedale, and was navigable by canoe during part of the year. These
factors inevitably made the confluence of the rivers a portage for east and
west traffic between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi. Pelts and trade
goods, passing back and forth from the East to the Southwest, and in reverse,
could travel by canoe all the way between Lake Erie and New Orleans
with the exception of a few miles at Kekionga. This short break in navigation
made the portage necessary; the geography of the rivers made it
possible. Here men were forced to carry canoe and cargo from the navigable
waters at the confluence of the rivers to the headwaters of the Wabash
River.</p>
<p>The portage at Kekionga brought relative prosperity to the Indian
rulers of this region, because a tribute for portage was levied upon every
canoeload of pelts and trade goods. Possession of this valuable location
afforded the Miami Indians at Kekionga political importance, too, because
economic advantage always makes for political interest. The political
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
power controlling the portage, therefore, dominated the commercial intercourse
of the area.</p>
<p>The French immediately sensed the importance of Kekionga and
located their post nearby at a very early date. The date of the coming of
the first white man to this area is unknown; some believe that Champlain
saw Three Rivers as early as 1614 or 1615. The earliest extant map, dated
1632, indicates that the Maumee River was then known to French cartographers.
Other maps drawn in 1654, 1656 and 1674 chart the rather thorough
exploration of the territory by the French. There is a possibility that
La Salle was on these rivers during the period between 1679 and 1681, for
he seemed to have known about the Wabash-Maumee Portage.</p>
<p>The Frenchman came on a peaceful mission. He sought trade with
the Indians and brought valuable commercial articles, which were strange,
new and desirable to the red man. The Frenchman was usually willing to
live with the Indian on terms of equality, and to take an Indian woman in
marriage. He wanted no occupation of the land; he did not seek to dispossess
the Indian; his missionaries sought no material advantage. At
first, these practices won the friendship and confidence of the simple child
of the forest, and the relations between Frenchman and Indian were usually
amicable.</p>
<p>French influence, then, in the interior of America and in the region
known today as the great Middle West, was paramount in the beginning because
of primacy of arrival. Meanwhile, the land-hungry English on the
Atlantic Coast rapidly expanded over the entire seaboard driving out the
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
Indians. The Appalachian Mountains long proved a barrier to English expansion
westward. Not until the English could acquire a suitable beast of
burden for conveying freight and merchandise across the mountains would
French influence in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys be jeopardized.</p>
<p>The date of establishment of the first French Post at the confluence
of the Rivers is veiled in the mists of the past. We only know, as these
mists lifted, that the French were located here in a small fort, block house,
or trading post which was named Post Miami. Probably of greater commercial
and religious, rather than political importance, it was situated on
the St. Mary&rsquo;s River near the present crossing of the Nickel Plate Railroad.
The French Officer Bissot may have been stationed here as commandant
in charge of French interests as early as 1697. Cadillac passed through
the portage on his way southward from Detroit in 1707; already English influence
was beginning to be felt in the area. The Miami Indian population
in and about the village approximated 400 persons. They subsisted from
their plantings along the Maumee River, from forest products and hunting,
and from their trade with the French.</p>
<p>Francois Margane succeeded Sieur Bissot as commandant at Post
Miami. He extended French influence and power by establishing, first,
Post Ouiatenon at the present location of Wabash, Indiana, and later, Post
Vincennes on the present site of the city of Vincennes. During the first
quarter of the eighteenth century the English began seriously to undermine
French influence with the Indians. This rivalry became more bitter and
culminated in an Indian uprising against the French who were not destined
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
to dominate the portage much longer. Soon they learned that the English
had erected a stronghold on Laramie Creek, a few miles from the present
site of Sidney, Ohio.</p>
<p>Chief Sanosket, known also as Chief Nicolas of the Hurons, fell
under British control; he made war against the French, and attacked a
number of French posts on the frontier. In alliance with the Miamis, the
Ottawas attacked Post Miami and partially burned the buildings. Ensign
Douville, the commandant, was absent in Detroit. The eight men forming
the garrison were captured, although two of them later escaped to Detroit.
To a certain extent, the French and Miamis soon adjusted their relations
because of mutual need for trade. However, the relationship thereafter
was never sincerely friendly. The ruined fort was partially restored but
gave much evidence of neglect. Father Jean de Bonnecamps recorded his
observations of the fort made in 1749. Griswold&rsquo;s <i>Pictorial History of
Fort Wayne</i>, vol. 1, p. 46 quotes the priest as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fort of the Miamis was in a very bad condition when we reached
it. Most of the palisades were decayed and fallen into ruin. There were
eight houses, or, to speak more correctly, eight miserable huts which
only the desire of making money could make endurable. The French there
number twenty-two; all of them including the commandant, had the fever.
Monsieur Raimond did not approve the situation of the fort and maintained
that it should be placed on the bank of the St. Joseph a scant league from
the present site. He wished to show me the spot, but the hindrances of
our departure prevented me from going hither. All I could do for him was
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
to trace the plan for his new fort. The latitude of the old one is 41 degrees
and 29 minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Raimond lost little time in relocating his fort. The site
he chose is the high ground near the present intersection of St. Joe Boulevard
and Delaware Avenue. The old buildings of the original French fort
served as a nucleus for a settlement and were now occupied by the few
Miami Indians who still remained on friendly terms with the French. The
little village came to be known as Coldfoot&rsquo;s village, in honor of Miami
Chief Coldfoot.</p>
<p>In the face of waning prestige, the French made one spirited attempt
to check the English. Under the leadership of Charles Langlade, a few
Frenchmen and two hundred Chippewas and Ottawas moved down from Detroit
to attack Fort Pickawillany. Assembling their forces at the portage near
Kekionga, they turned into the St. Mary&rsquo;s River, and thence marched overland
unheralded toward Pickawillany. After a surprise attack the fort was
reduced. In celebration of the victory, and in vengeance for his friendship
with the British, the Indians enjoyed a cannibal feast on the body of
La Demoiselle, chief of the Piankeshaws. This victory temporarily restored
the prestige of France with the Miamis at the portage. The defeat
of Braddock in 1755 still further diminished the influence of the English
among the Indians. Thus, the battle of propaganda and bribery for the favor
of the Indian tribes seesawed back and forth. The pendulum, however, was
swinging in favor of the British.</p>
<p>During the next few years British political emissaries and traders
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
made ever-increasing trouble for the French; these machinations foreshadowed
the destruction of French power in the Ohio Valley. The small
French garrison, and French half-breed families living in the present Spy
Run Avenue neighborhood, led a precarious existence. The local Indians,
aided and abetted by the English, and well-fortified with whiskey
(hitherto denied them by the French) now liberally dispensed by the British,
increasingly harassed their former French allies.</p>
<p>In 1756, the Seven Years&rsquo; War, known in American history as the
French and Indian War, broke out between France and England. One of the
prizes at stake in the contest was the domination of the North American
continent. After the fall of Quebec, concomitant with the defeat of General
Montcalm by General Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham, French authority in
North America passed to the English. Shortly thereafter, the garrison at
Detroit surrendered to the English. In December, 1760, Lieutenant Butler,
commanding a detachment of twenty English soldiers, received the surrender
of Fort Miami. Thereafter, the Union Jack flew over the Maumee
portage.</p>
<p>During the period beginning in 1760 and ending with the termination
of the Revolutionary War, British policy seems to have emphasized commerce
and conciliation with the local Indians. British military forces were
never strong in the area, and now that the French were vanquished, the
stockade no longer possessed military value. Fort Miami fell into decay.</p>
<p>A brief era of good feeling between the Indians and the British followed.
Soon, however, there were stirrings among the red men. The great
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
Pontiac, chief of the Ottawas, a man of superior intelligence and great
skill in statecraft, began inciting the Indians to expel the British from the
entire western country. For a long time the conspiracy and war preparations
continued in secret; not until 1763 were they revealed. Soon the
Indians attacked and laid siege to all the British forts on the entire frontier;
they captured Forts Sandusky, St. Joseph, Michilmackinac, Ouiatanon and
Miami.</p>
<p>At least one romantic but tragic incident occurred in connection
with the attack on Post Miami. Ensign Holmes, English Commandant at
the isolated British fort on the St. Joseph River, was a young and very lonely
man. Rumor has it that he shared few common interests with the men of
his garrison. He sought feminine companionship and found favor in the
eyes of an Indian maiden who reciprocated his affections.</p>
<p>Let Parkman tell the story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 27th day of May, a young Indian girl, who lived with the
commandant, came to tell him that a squaw lay dangerously ill in a wigwam
near the fort, and urged him to come to her relief. Having confidence in
the girl, Holmes forgot his caution and followed her out of the fort. Pitched
on the edge of a meadow (in present-day Lakeside), hidden from view by
an intervening spur of woodland, stood a great number of Indian wigwams.
When Holmes came in sight of them his treacherous conductress pointed
out that in which the sick woman lay. He walked on without suspicion, but,
as he drew near, two guns flashed from behind the hut and stretched him
lifeless on the grass. The shots were heard at the fort and the sergeant
rashly went out to learn the cause. He was immediately taken prisoner,
amid exulting yells and whoopings. The soldiers in the fort climbed upon
the palisades to look out, when Godefroy, a Canadian, and two other white
men, made their appearance and summoned them to surrender, promising
that if they did so their lives would be spared.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcapc small"><span class="sf">During the period of the Chief Nicolas conspiracy, in 1747, while the commandant,
Ensign Douville, was absent at Detroit, the savages attacked the post
situated on the St. Mary&rsquo;s river in the present city of Fort Wayne and partially
destroyed it with fire. The post was rebuilt, and later, in 1750 a new fort was
established on the left bank of the St. Joseph river. The drawing is after an
old woodcut.</span></p>
<p class="center">From Griswold&rsquo;s <i>Pictorial History
of Fort Wayne, Indiana</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Ultimately Pontiac&rsquo;s Conspiracy was quelled and uneasy peace was
restored on the frontier. At the beginning of the American Revolution the
British were confronted with the problem of retaining the Indians as allies
against the Americans. The savages realized the need of British subsidies
and soon became genuinely attached to the redcoats.</p>
<p>In October, 1778, Governor Hamilton&rsquo;s army, advancing from Detroit
against the forces of George Rogers Clark in southern Indiana, passed over
the portage. The only military action, however, which occurred here during
the Revolutionary War is known as La Balme&rsquo;s Massacre.</p>
<p>Augustus La Balme, one of the volunteer French officers who had
accompanied the Marquis de LaFayette to America, was commissioned a
colonel in General Washington&rsquo;s army. In October he appeared at Kaskaskia,
then under American domination since its capture by George Rogers Clark.
He gathered a considerable force of Frenchmen and Indians and advanced
northward, his objective being the expulsion of the British from Detroit.
Arriving at the Indian settlement at Three Rivers, La Balme and his men
plundered the village and destroyed a great deal of property. At close of
day he retired with his 103 men and camped on the Aboite River. In the
dead of night an Indian force under the leadership of Little Turtle attacked
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
the invader, destroyed nearly a half of the little force and compelled the
remainder to flee. The incident has little significance except as the initial
engagement in a series of bloody victories won by Little Turtle and
the Miami Indians against the Americans.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Paris in 1783 made the United States nominally paramount
in the Ohio Valley. However, the British, on the pretext of bad
faith on the part of the American Government, continued to occupy forts
in the area which they had contracted to evacuate under terms of the treaty.
Among the forts they still held illegally were Presque Isle, Mackinac,
Detroit, and Fort Miami near Toledo.</p>
<p>From the vantage point of these forts, British military officers and
diplomatic representatives continued friendly relations with the local Indians.
By moral suasion the Indian was influenced to believe that his friends
were British rather than American. Through gifts of food, equipment and
arms, the Indian was relieved of problems of logistics which might place
him at a disadvantage with any American military force. The Indians massacred
hundreds of American settlers on the western frontier, and burned and
pillaged their homes. Under the leadership of Little Turtle and others in
1790 and 1791, Indian warriors inflicted overwhelming defeats upon the
armies of American Generals Harmar and St. Clair.</p>

<p>American influence and prestige were at a low ebb, indeed, and it
appeared that the Ohio Valley with the portage at Three Rivers might fall by
default to the British after all. In order to prevent this calamity, General
Wayne undertook his campaign westward into the Indian country from
Pittsburgh. He soundly defeated the Indians at Fallen Timbers in 1794.
Wayne&rsquo;s expedition culminated in the building of the fort which bears his
name and in the formal occupation under the American flag in September
and October, 1794.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
